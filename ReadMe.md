# Display-inline

 Change the Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers to force images and pdf documents to open in the browser window.

 Similar to InlineDisposition, InlineDisposition 2, Bypass Forced Download etc. The main difference is that this addon will guess the content type from the file name if the server sends `application/octet-type`, and it is implemented as a WebExtension.

 Does not work everywhere.
